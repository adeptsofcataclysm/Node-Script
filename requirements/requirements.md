# Requirements

**Normative source:** [`vision.md`](./vision.md). This document restates that vision as testable **requirements** (the word **shall** indicates a mandatory behavior). No implementation, stack, or repository layout is assumed.

**Terms:** Capitalized role and feature names match the glossary in [`vision.md`](./vision.md).
